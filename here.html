        What has been heavy on your mind lately? What do you wish for? When do you feel safe/comfortable? What has been bothering you? What do you hide from others? What do you fear? How do you do your best? What do you dream of? When do you feel overwhelmed? When do you feel vulnerable? What is your secret? What do you want people to know? Who are you in front of other people?
