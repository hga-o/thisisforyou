        This is for you is a small publication that consists of thoughts from a stranger. It quietly offers those who decide to engage with it a voice from an anonymous individual. Thoughts that are usually kept silent and personal were able to enter a public space, but still at a one-to-one level. Five issues were distributed within a period of five days (1 issue per day) in a box mounted near the elevator on the first floor of the Design Center. Each issue has words from a single person responding the questions, "What have you been thinking of recently?" and "What has been heavy on your mind lately?" The box started each day with around 30 editions of each issue, and ended the day empty. It can be argued that the purpose of this publication and its distribution was to surface vulnerabilities that people keep to themselves and create a narrative that is honest. Perhaps this is a reminder (for you? For me?) that most people are also still figuring it out. But this could also all just be because I like secrets.
